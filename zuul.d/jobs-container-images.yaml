    description: |
      This is a parent for an image build job which expects a
      buildset registry to be running and pulls images from the
      intermediate registry into it.  It mostly exists so that
      the intermediate registry secret need not be supplied to the
      image build playbook.
    parent: ansible-buildset-registry
    run: playbooks/container-image/run.yaml
